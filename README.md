# **SkyBound - An Interactive Orrery Web App**



Welcome to SkyBound, an interactive web application that brings the solar system to life! Inspired by the historical orreries, SkyBound presents a modern, digital version where you can view and explore celestial bodies like planets, Near-Earth Asteroids, Near-Earth Comets, and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids.

## **🌟 Introduction**

SkyBound is built with Svelte, offering an engaging way to interact with and understand our solar system. Rotate the view, zoom in to specific celestial objects, and gain insights into the spatial arrangement of planets, comets, and asteroids—all from your web browser.

## **🚀 Features**

SkyBound offers several unique features:

1. **Solar System Exploration**: A model of the solar system, allowing users to view and rotate the entire system at different angles.
2. **Celestial Bodies Overview**: Displays planets, Near-Earth Asteroids, Near-Earth Comets, and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids.
3. **Intuitive Controls**: Navigate and rotate the solar system in a user-friendly, interactive interface.
4. **Visual Representation**: Get a clear view of the spatial positioning of planets and other celestial objects.
5. **Future Enhancements** (coming soon): Potentially interactive features such as selecting individual planets for detailed information.

## **🛠️ Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**: Svelte, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js (for future server interactions)
- **Rendering**: WebGL for 3D visualization

## **📚 Application**

SkyBound serves as an educational and exploratory tool:

1. **Educational Purposes**: Aids students and astronomy enthusiasts in visualizing the arrangement of celestial objects.
2. **Interactive Learning**: Offers an interactive way to understand the scale and positioning of planets and other objects in the solar system.
3. **Public Awareness**: Can be used in public displays or classrooms to raise awareness about Near-Earth objects and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids.
